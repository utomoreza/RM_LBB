# Learning by Building RM (Regression Model)

This repo consists of all folders and files needed for the project of "Learning by Building" of [Regression Model](https://algorit.ma/course/regression-models/) course at Algoritma.

The programming language used in this repo is R. I wrote an R markdown file of this repo. If you prefer to read the notebook in Python language, you could see it [here](https://github.com/utomoreza/WhiteWineQuality_LR).

I published the Rmarkdown on RPubs. You can view it [here](https://rpubs.com/utomoreza/RM_LBB).

Feel free if you'd like to clone or download the repo.

Thanks for visiting my repo!
