# Learning by Building DV (Data Visualization)

This repo consists of all folders and files needed for the project of "Learning by Building" of [Data Visualization](https://algorit.ma/course/data-visualization/) course at Algoritma.

The programming language used in this repo is R. I also wrote an R markdown file of this repo so that you can view the repo tidier. I published the markdown on two sites, i.e. RPubs and GitHub. You can view it either from the following links:

* [GitHub Page](https://utomoreza.github.io/DV_LBB/): `not published yet`
* [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/utomoreza/DV_LBB): `not published yet`

Feel free if you'd like to clone or download the repo.

Thanks for visiting my repo!
